# Dotfiles

My configuration files for Neovim (nightly), VSCodium and the LF file manager.

Also includes my KDE Plasma desktop layout.  
You can import this using the [Plasma Customization Saver](https://store.kde.org/p/1298955/).

## Requirements

Both LF and Neovim require a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) in order to look as intended.
